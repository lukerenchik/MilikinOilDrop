# MilikinOilDrop
Calculator used to find the elementary charge of a electron.
This is a program I developed for a Physics 2 lab to find the charge of single electron. The program takes data points in qDrop1-qDropN which measure the amount of total charge in a oil droplet. The program then loops through and finds the best fitting lowest common multiple of their individual charges.
